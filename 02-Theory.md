* Criteria for evaluating information content and effectiveness
* Case studies
* Introduction to Observable Plot

## For today...

* Q1: Create 10 criteria/questions for assessing the effectiveness and information content of a visualization.
  For example, here are two:
  * Is it exploratory or explanatory?
  * Who's the audience? (General? Technical? Students?...)
  * There are several books on O'Reilly by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic that have examples. 
  [Storytelling with data](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/storytelling-with-data/9781119002253/) is fine for this task.
* Q2: Provide a link to a visualization that you consider to be particularly compelling.
* Q3: Evaluate the visualization you selected in Q2 by using it to answer your questions in Q1
