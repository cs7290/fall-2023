## reading

* [schedule.md](schedule.md)

## assignments -- grading policy

The only way to learn this material is with practice!

* 9.5 is an A -- that's the maximum grade on a transcript
* 10 is exceptional (A+) -- sort of like a major award
* 0 -- a couple ways to get this
  * 0 if I can't access the notebook -- fix and resubmit for regrade
  * 0 for no submission -- fix and resubmit for regrade
* Anything below a 9...
  * regrade option to get a possible 9/10 maximum
  * copy and paste without attribution -- not good -- might be plagiarism (chatgpt plagiarizes)
  * attribution is good -- referencing documentation is good
  * forking = attribution

## peer review

* continuing on assessments
* in the near future, we'll be reviewing our own
* multiple teams working on similar projects

## prototype

* PMA project (last week)
* NECS project (this week)
