# 07-Stakeholder -- README

This week was initially 07-Geo but we meet with the PMA stakeholder -- 07-Geo didn't happen

* Review the geospatial stuff
* Individual projects -- let students know about theirs
  * Can work as team or as individual on a portfolio piece
  * Either way, I'm here as consultant
* Figure out how to include NECS
* Next week will be D3, then we can rearrange topics to suit student interest
