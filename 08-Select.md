  * NCES project
  * Bioscience project
  * Individual project(s)
* Next set of modules may depend on individual projects

## PMA Story (as discussed on 26 Oct)

* Explanatory: Story
  * Charles Shipman dominates (e.g., Bar chart in Team 3)
  * After 2020 (baseline), there's a decline -- which was their desired goal (3%/year)
  * There's may be a slow rise from beginning to 2020
    * But there's a large dip around 2017 (unclear where it comes from)
  * There is a seasonal signal that's most evident in electric usage at Charles Shipman
  * Leave out potable water
* Exploratory dashboard
  * Elements of Jesse's plot (team 3) might make sense here
  * Other teams will have other ideas (e.g., dots and heatmap for Team 1)
